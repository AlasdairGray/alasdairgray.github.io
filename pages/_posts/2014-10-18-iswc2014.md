[ISWC 2014](http://iswc2014.semanticweb.org) is taking place on the shores of [Lake Garda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riva_del_Garda), Italy. However, I won’t have much time to relax on the lake. Look out for my tweets ([@gray_alasdair](https://twitter.com/gray_alasdair)).

My conference activities start on Sunday 19 October with the first workshop on Context, Interpretation and Meaning ([CIM2014](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~fm206/cim14/)), which together with [Harry Halpin](http://www.ibiblio.org/hhalpin/) ([W3C](http://www.w3.org/)) and [Fiona McNeill](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~fm206/) ([Heriot-Watt University](http://www.hw.ac.uk)) I am a chair. We have managed to put together an interesting selection of [5 papers](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~fm206/cim14/accepted-papers.html) – two focusing on the context of links, two on the interpretation of alignments and one on the meaning of mappings. I am a co-author on this final paper, but [Kerstin Forsberg](http://kerfors.blogspot.it/) will be presenting the work {% cite Hussain2014CIM %}. We also have an exciting panel session in store with [Aldo Gangemi](http://www.istc.cnr.it/people/aldo-gangemi) (CNR), [Paul Groth](http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0183-6910) (VU University of Amsterdam) and Harry Halpin.

Also taking place on Sunday is the Linked Science Workshop ([LISC](http://linkedscience.org/events/lisc2014/)). Together with [Simon Jupp](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~jupp/) and [James Malone](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~malone/) of the [EBI](http://www.ebi.ac.uk) we have a paper on modelling the provenance for linksets of convenience {% cite JuppMG14 %}. A linkset of convenience is one that does not model the underlying science correctly, but provides a convenient shortcut for linking data. An example from the world of biology is a linkset that directly links genes with their protein product.

On Monday I will be working with the W3C RDF Stream Processing ([RSP](http://www.w3.org/community/rsp/)) Community Group. We have been having regular phone meetings for the last year and have made great progress towards defining a common community model for RDF streams and a query language for processing them. The group will largely be attending the [Stream Ordering Workshop](http://streamreasoning.org/events/ordring2014) and the [Semantic Sensor Networks Workshop](http://knoesis.org/ssn2014/).

Tuesday is the first day of ISWC, and it is going to be a busy one for me. In the morning I will be presenting the Open PHACTS paper on our work enabling scientific lenses for chemistry data {% cite Batchelor:SciLenses:ISWC2014 %}. In the evening I will be at the poster and demonstration session showing off the Open PHACTS [VoID Editor](http://voideditor.cs.man.ac.uk/) {% cite Goble:VoIDEditor:ISWC2014 %}.

Finally, I am organising the [Lightning Talks](http://iswc2014.semanticweb.org/lightning_talk_news) session on the last day of the conference. This is a session where you can present late breaking results or responses to work presented in the conference. Talks will be 5 minutes each and abstracts can be submitted until 8.30 am on Thursday.

After ISWC I think I’m going to need a break.
