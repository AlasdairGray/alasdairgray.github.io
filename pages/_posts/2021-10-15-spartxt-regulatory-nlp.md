[SPaR.txt](https://github.com/rubenkruiper/spar.txt) is the result of a recent pilot project conducted with my colleague [Ioannis Konstas](http://www.ikonstas.net/) jointly with [Bimal Kumar](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/our-staff/k/bimal-kumar/) and [Richard Watson](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/our-staff/w/richard-watson/) from [Northumbria University](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/). We are investigating using NLP techniques jointly with Knowledge Graphs to extract requirements from the UK's building regulations. SPaR.txt, developed by our RA [Ruben Kruiper](https://github.com/rubenkruiper), allows for extracting terms with little training required. This was shown over the [Scottish building regulations](https://www.gov.scot/policies/building-standards/monitoring-improving-building-regulations/) since they are openly available in a machine processable format. This provides the first stepping stone to being able to automate the extraction  of requirements from regulatory texts.
