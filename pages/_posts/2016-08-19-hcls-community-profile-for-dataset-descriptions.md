My latest publication {% cite Dumontier:HCLS-datadesc:PeerJ2016 %} describes the process followed in developing the W3C Health Care and Life Sciences Interest Group ([HCLSIG](https://www.w3.org/blog/hcls/)) [community profile for dataset descriptions](https://www.w3.org/TR/hcls-dataset/)Â which was published last year. The diagram below provides a summary of the data model for describing datasets which covers 61 metadata terms drawn from 18 vocabularies.
