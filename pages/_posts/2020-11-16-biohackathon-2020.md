This year, due to the pandemic, the [European BioHackathon](https://2020.biohackathon-europe.org/) went virtual. Despite the online only nature of the event, it was well attended and there were more topics than ever – [41 topics](https://2020.biohackathon-europe.org/projects) – covering both the usual ELIXIR topics and some dedicated to the COVID response. 
[Bioschemas](https://bioschemas.org) was again well represented in different hacking projects. This year the focus was on exploiting Bioschemas markup for different communities. 

The main focus of the work was showing that the [IDPcentral registry](https://idpcentral.org/) could be populated using Bioschemas markup. [Protein](https://bioschemas.org/profile/Protein) markup was scraped  from three intrinsically disordered protein resources – [DisProt](https://disprot.org/), [MobiDB](https://mobidb.org/), and [ProteinEnsemble](https://proteinensemble.org/). The scraped data was merged and converted into the existing IDPcentral registry model. We also generated a knowledge graph over which some initial analysis queries were run, e.g. identifying which proteins are found in more than one source. The work can be found in this [notebook](https://github.com/elixir-europe/BioHackathon-projects-2020/blob/master/projects/24/IDPCentral/notebooks/IDPCentralETLProcess.ipynb). We plan to carry on implementing this work and extending beyond a sample of pages from each site.

Within the plant community, we formalised the mapping between [MIAPPE](https://www.miappe.org/) (the minimum information model for plant phenotyping experiments) and [Bioschemas Study profile](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/Study). This will be tested in the coming weeks on the [PIPPA](https://pippa.psb.ugent.be/) site for phenotype experiments.

[Egon Willighagen](https://egonw.github.io/) used [BMUSE](https://github.com/HW-SWeL/BMUSE) to scrape [MolecularEntity](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/MolecularEntity) markup from [MassBank](https://massbank.eu/) compound pages. The table below reports the statistics on the data that was scraped.
