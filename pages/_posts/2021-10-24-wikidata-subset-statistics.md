[Wikidata](https://wikidata.org/) has the ability to provide references for each and every statement that it stores. This paper builds on [Seyed's](https://seyedahbr.github.io/) earlier work to [create topical subsets over Wikidata](/posts/2021-06-08-topical-subsets). Here we focus on the provision of references for statements in 6 topical subsets of Wikidata and report summary statistics to report on their usage.
