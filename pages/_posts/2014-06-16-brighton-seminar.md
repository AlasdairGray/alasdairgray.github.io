I recently gave a [seminar](http://about.brighton.ac.uk/cem/research/seminars/2014/may21seminar.php) on my work in the [Open PHACTS](http://www.openphacts.org) project in the [seminar series](http://about.brighton.ac.uk/cem/research/conferences/index.php?PageId=900) of the [School of Computing, Engineering and Mathematics](http://about.brighton.ac.uk/cem/), [University of Brighton](http://www.brighton.ac.uk/).

I had a lovely trip and enjoyed wondering around the city. There was also the chance to have discussions on various aspects of the work and common ground.

Slides and the abstract for the talk are available below.

## Abstract

When are two data resources in different datasets the same? If they have the same name, properties, or some other criteria? The choice depends upon the application to which the data will be put. However, existing Linked Data approaches provide a single global view over the data with no way of varying the notion of equivalence to be applied.

In this presentation, I will introduce Scientific lenses, an approach that enables applications to vary the equivalence conditions between linked datasets. They have been deployed in the Open PHACTS Discovery Platform – a large scale data integration platform for drug discovery.

To cater for different use cases, the platform allows the application of different lenses which vary the equivalence rules to be applied based on the context and interpretation of the links.
