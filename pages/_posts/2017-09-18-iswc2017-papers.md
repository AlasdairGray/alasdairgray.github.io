I have had two papers accepted within the events that make up [ISWC2017](http://iswc2017.semanticweb.org).

My PhD student [Qianru Zhou](http://home.eps.hw.ac.uk/~qz1/) has been working on using RDF stream processing to detect anomalous events through telecommunication network messages. The particular scenario in our paper that will be presented at the [Web Stream Processing](http://streamreasoning.org/events/wsp2017) workshop focuses on detecting a disaster such as the capsizing of the [Eastern Star on the Yangtze River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_Dongfang_zhi_Xing) {% cite ZhouEtal2017:LostSilence:WSP2017 %}.

The second paper is a poster in the main conference that provides an overview of the [Bioschemas](http://bioschemas.org) project where we are identifying the [Schema.org](http://schema.org) markup that is of primary importance for life science resources. Hopefully the paper title will pull the punters in for the session {% cite Gray:BioschemasPotatoSalad:ISWC2017 %}.
