Today, the [Semantic Web Lab](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/SWeL) hosted the [6th Scottish Linked Data Interest Group workshop](https://sites.google.com/site/scottishlinkeddata/events/sliding6)Â at [Heriot-Watt University](http://www.hw.ac.uk). The event was sponsored by the [SICSA Data Science Theme](https://www.sicsa.ac.uk/research/research-themes/data-science/). The event was well attended with 30 researchers from across Scotland (and Newcastle) coming together for a day of flash talks and discussions. Live minutes were captured during the day and can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SmWqGpFnQjLC1GfnhBuKrAFVZoVRVjzatDErW2-tzZE/edit?usp=sharing).

I gave a talk on the successes and challenges of [FAIR data](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618). My slides are embedded below.
