I was asked to speak at the School (Faculty) of Mathematical and Computer Sciences ([MACS](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk)) Christmas conference. I decided I would have some fun with the presentation.

**Title:** Project X

<!--more-->

**Abstract:** For the last 11 months I have been working on a top secret project with a world renowned Scandinavian industry partner. We are now moving into the exciting operational phase of this project. I have been granted an early lifting of the embargo that has stopped me talking about this work up until now. I will talk about the data science behind this big data project and how semantic web technology has enabled the delivery of Project X.
