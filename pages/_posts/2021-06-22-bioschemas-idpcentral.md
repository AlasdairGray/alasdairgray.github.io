The main topic that I focused on at last year's virtual [BioHackathon](https://2020.biohackathon-europe.org/) was using  Bioschemas markup scraped from web pages about proteins known to be disordered and populating this data into a registry ([IDPcentral](https://dev.idpcentral.org/registry)). We've refined the process, and markup, quite a bit since the hackathon, resulting in one [notebook](https://github.com/elixir-europe/BioHackathon-projects-2020/blob/master/projects/24/IDPCentral/notebooks/ETLProcess.ipynb) that transforms the scraped data files into a consolidated knowledge graph and another [notebook](https://github.com/elixir-europe/BioHackathon-projects-2020/blob/master/projects/24/IDPCentral/notebooks/AnalysisQueries.ipynb) which runs some simple analysis queries, including the [HCLS Dataset Description](https://www.w3.org/TR/hcls-dataset/#s6_6) metadata statistic queries.
