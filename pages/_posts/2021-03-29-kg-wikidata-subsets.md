One of the topics that my PhD student [Seyed](https://seyedahbr.github.io/) and I were involved with at last year's virtual [BioHackathon](https://2020.biohackathon-europe.org/) was subsetting knowledge graphs and Wikidata. Our hacking group, led by [Jose Labra Gayo](https://labra.weso.es/) has now written up our findings, covering use cases and existing tooling for subsetting.
