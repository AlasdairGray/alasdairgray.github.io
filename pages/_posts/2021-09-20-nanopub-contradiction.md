This paper is the result of a collaboration with [Ilaria Tiddi](https://kmitd.github.io/ilaria/), an Assistant Profssor at the VU Amsterdam, which came about after one of her trips visiting Edinburgh. Ilaria has been involved in the creation of the Collaboration Databank ([CoDa](https://cooperationdatabank.org/)) which contains summaries of social science experiments on collaboration. We explored whether it would be possible to use a [nanopublication](http:/.nanopub.org/) representation, with rich provenance information, to detect contradictory results and suggest potential causes for the contradiction.
