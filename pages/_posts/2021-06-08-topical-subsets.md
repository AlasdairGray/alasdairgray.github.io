[Wikidata](https://wikidata.org/) is an amazing source of data. However, it's [query service](https://query.wikidata.org/) is limited to relatively straightforward queries due to fair usage timeouts, and its size makes it impractical for most people to use locally. To evaluate his PhD work on references, [Seyed](https://seyedahbr.github.io/) will need to process complex queries, so we need a mechanism to construct representative subsets of the whole. This paper explores our initial ideas on creating topical subsets from Wikidata.
