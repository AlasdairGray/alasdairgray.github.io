	abstract = {The life sciences have a wealth of data resources with a wide range of overlapping content. Key repositories, such as UniProt for protein data or Entrez Gene for gene data, are well known and their content easily discovered through search engines. However, there is a long-tail of bespoke datasets with important content that are not so prominent in search results. Building on the success of Schema.org for making a wide range of structured web content more discoverable and interpretable, e.g. food recipes, the Bioschemas community (http://bioschemas.org) aim to make life sciences datasets more findable by encouraging data providers to embed Schema.org markup in their resources.}

	abstract = {We present the Open PHACTS linked data platform that is being developed to support a wide range of novel drug discovery applications. The functionality offered by the platform has been drawn from a collection of prioritised drug discovery business questions created as part of the Open PHACTS project, a collaboration of research institutions and major pharmaceutical companies.

The discovery of new medicines requires pharmacologists to interact with a number of data sources; ranging from data on chemical compounds to their interactions with targets. The linked data platform provides an integrated view over data retrieved from several complementary, but overlapping, data sources

Key features of the Open PHACTS linked data platform are:
1) Domain specific API making drug discovery linked data available for a diverse range of applications without requiring the application developers to become knowledgeable of semantic web standards such as SPARQL;
2) Just-in-time identity resolution and alignment across datasets enabling a variety of entry points to the data and ultimately to support different integrated views of the data;
3) Centrally cached copies of public datasets to support interactive response times for user-facing applications.

The Open PHACTS platform is hosted by OpenLink using the Virtuoso triplestore. This is enabling us to provide the security and privacy guarantees required by pharmaceutical companies. We have recently begun beta testing of the platform with our associated partners and anticipate a full public roll-out later in 2013.  

The utility of the linked data platform is demonstrated by the variety of drug discovery applications being built to access the integrated data.},

The platform retrieves data from many complementary, but overlapping, data sources to present an integrated view of the data.

The single concept URI provided by the resolution service is then expanded to a set of equivalent URIs used by the data sources.

Queries are compiled into imperative query execution plans, which are translated into executable nesC source code. In this paper, we illustrate the lifecycle of a SNEEql query Q for in-network execution. This lifecycle encompasses the steps of preparatory metadata collection, followed by the compilation of Q into a query execution plan QEP, the dissemination of binary images implementing QEP throughout the WSN, and the generation of query results.},

	abstract = {Sensor Networks have received considerable attention recently, as they provide manifold benefits. Not only are they a means for data acquisition and monitoring of unexplored or inaccessible areas, they are also a low-cost alternative for sensing the environment, which greatly aids to better understand our surroundings. A major motivation in either occasion is to acknowledge endangering situations and take action(s) accordingly. To this end, we would like to enable data mining or analysis techniques on top or, even better, within such networks, due to the prohibitive cost of communication in this setting. In this work, we demonstrate running data mining algorithms on a set of sensors, which are of low-processing power. In addition to showcasing the execution of data analysis algorithms on resource-constrained hardware, our demo is intended to show how to take advantage of the properties of each algorithm to make better use of the sensors and their capabilities. We support the execution and monitoring of these algorithms with a graphical user interface (GUI).},
