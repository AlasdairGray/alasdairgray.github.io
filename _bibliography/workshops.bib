  abstract = {Automated Compliance Checking (ACC) systems aim to semantically parse building regulations to a set of rules. However, semantic parsing is known to be hard and requires large amounts of training data. The complexity of creating such training data has led to research that focuses on small sub-tasks, such as shallow parsing or the extraction of a limited subset of rules. This study introduces a shallow parsing task for which training data is relatively cheap to create, with the aim of learning a lexicon for ACC. We annotate a small domain-specific dataset of 200 sentences, SPaR.txt, and train a sequence tagger that achieves 79,93 F1-score on the test set. We then show through manual evaluation that the model identifies most (89,84%) defined terms in a set of building regulation documents, and that both contiguous and discontiguous Multi-Word Expressions (MWE) are discovered with reasonable accuracy (70,3%).},

In the modern world telecommunication systems can and do play a key role in ensuring a successful emergency response by detecting such incidents through significant changes in calls and access to the networks. In this paper a methodology is illustrated to detect such incidents immediately (with the delay in the order of milliseconds), by processing semantically annotated streams of data in cellular telecommunication systems. In our methodology, live information of phones' positions and status are encoded as RDF streams. We propose an algorithm that processes streams of RDF annotated telecommunication data to detect abnormality. Our approach is exemplified in the context of capsize of a passenger cruise ship but is readily translatable to other incidents. Our evaluation results show that with properly chosen window size, such incidents can be detected effectively.},

Synthetically generated datasets for which ground truth is known are helpful but the data typically are too clean to be representative of historical records. We assess data linkage algorithms under different data quality scenarios, e.g. with errors typical of historical transcriptions. A data corrupting model injects four types of mistakes: character level (e.g. an f is represented as an s – OCR Corruptions), attribute level (e.g. male changed to female due to false entry), record level (e.g. missing records), and group of records level (e.g. coffee spilt over a page, lost parish records in fire). We then evaluate record linkage algorithms over synthetically generated datasets with known ground truth and data corruptions matching a given profile.},

  abstract =     {Access to consistent, high-quality metadata is critical to finding, understanding, and reusing scientific data. However, while there are many relevant vocabularies for the annotation of a dataset, none sufficiently captures all the necessary metadata. This prevents uniform indexing and querying of dataset repositories. Towards providing a practical guide for producing a high quality description of biomedical datasets, the W3C Semantic Web for Health Care and the Life Sciences Interest Group (HCLSIG) identified Resource Description Framework (RDF) vocabularies that could be used to specify common metadata elements and their value sets. The resulting HCLS community profile covers elements of description, identification, attribution, versioning, provenance, and content summarization. The HCLS community profile reuses existing vocabularies, and is intended to meet key functional requirements including indexing, discovery, exchange, query, and retrieval of datasets, thereby enabling the publication of FAIR data. The resulting metadata profile is generic and could be used by other domains with an interest in providing machine readable descriptions of versioned datasets.

The goal of this presentation is to give an overview of the HCLS Community Profile and explain how it extends and builds upon other approaches.},

However, experiences from several research projects have demonstrated that the mappings are not enough. Also the context of the mappings is needed to enable interpretation of the meaning of the mappings. Built upon these experi- ences, we introduce a semantic framework for representing, evaluating and uti- lizing terminology mappings together with the context in terms of the justifica- tions for, and the provenance of, the mappings. The framework offers a plat- form for i) performing various mappings strategies, ii) representing terminology mappings together with their provenance information, and iii) enabling termi- nology reasoning for inferring both new and erroneous mappings. We present the results of the introduced framework using the SALUS project where we evaluated the quality of both existing and inferred terminology mappings among standard terminologies.},

  abstract =     {Sensor networks have become ubiquitous and their proliferation in day-to-day life provides new research challenges. Sensors deployed at forest sites, high performance facilities, or areas striken by environmental, or other, phenomena, are only a few representative examples. More recently, mobile sensor networks have made their presence and are rapidly growing in numbers, such as the successful ZebraNet project or PDAs and smartphones. Nevertheless, such networks have mainly been used for data acquisition and data are being processed externally instead of in-network. Basic research problems that arise in the in-network setting include how to adjust in a timely and efficient manner to changing conditions and network topology. In this paper, we present a methodology, based on declarative query processing to alleviate the aforementioned problems, by making the deployment and optimization of a data analysis application as automatic as possible, which also helps execution in mobile environments. Our proposed solution focuses on extending a state-of-the-art sensor network platform, SNEE, with builtin data analysis capabilities.},
