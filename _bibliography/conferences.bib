  abstract={We tackle the problem of automatically detecting conflicting claims in research outputs. This has become even more urgent in recent years, with the increasing volume of scientific publications available. Researchers are struggling to keep pace with the literature, and to efficiently make comparisons between the results of different published studies. We hypothesise that the difficult and time-consuming process of searching and comparing results across research publications can be facilitated using machine-readable, standardised knowledge representation methods. To this end, we propose to exploit Nanopublications as the standard framework to represent the claims in research studies, and use provenance data expressed by the model as an indicator of the source of the contradiction between different claims. We evaluate this idea over the Cooperation Databank (CoDa); a repository of social science studies. Our results show that the use of provenance information can be a good factor to identify the cause of conflicting claims, and that our method can support scientists in comparing literature in a more automated way.},

  abstract={Nanopublications are a granular way of publishing scientific claims together with their associated provenance and publication information. More than 10 million nanopublications have been published by a handful of researchers covering a wide range of topics within the life sciences. We were motivated to replicate an existing analysis of these nanopublications, but then went deeper into the structure of the existing nanopublications. In this paper, we analyse the usage of nanopublications by investigating the distribution of triples in each part and discuss the data quality issues that were subsequently revealed. We argue that there is a need for the community to develop a set of guidelines for the modelling of nanopublications.},  keywords={},  doi={10.1109/eScience.2019.00069},

The core classes and relationships forming the ontology are discussed in detail. The ToCo ontology can describe the physical infrastructure, quality of channel, services and users in heterogeneous telecommunication networks which span multiple technology domains. The DIL pattern is observed and summarised when modelling networks with various technology domains. Examples and use cases of ToCo are presented for demonstration.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we present SARA, a Semantic Access point Resource Allocation service for heterogenous wireless networks with various wireless access technologies existing together. By automatically reasoning on the knowledge base of the full system provided by a knowledge based autonomic network management system - SEANET, SARA selects the access point providing the best quality of service among the different access technologies. Based on an ontology assisted knowledge based system SEANET, SARA can also adapt the access point selection strategy according to customer defined rules automatically. Results of our evaluation based on emulated networks with hybrid access technologies and various scales show that SARA is able to improve the channel condition, in terms of throughput, evidently. Comparisons with current AP selection algorithms demonstrate that SARA outperforms the existing AP selection algorithms. The overhead in terms of time expense is reasonable and is shown to be faster than traditional access point selection approaches.},

  abstract  = {Modern Software Defined Networking (SDN) control stacks consist of multiple abstraction and virtualization layers to enable flexibility in the development of new control features. Rich data modeling frameworks are essential when sharing information across control layers. Unfortunately, existing Network Operating System (NOS) data modeling capabilities are limited to simple type-checking and code templating. We present an exploration of a more extreme point on SDN data modeling: ReasoNet. Developers can use semantic web technologies to enrich their data models with reasoning rules and integrity/consistency constraints, and automate state inference across layers. We demonstrate the ability of ReasoNet to automate state verification and cross-layer debugging, through the implementation of two popular control applications, a learning switch and a Quality of Service (QoS) policy engine.},

  abstract  = {Sensing devices are increasingly being deployed to monitor the physical world around us. One class of application for which sensor data is pertinent is environmental decision support systems, e.g. flood emergency response. However, in order to interpret the readings from the sensors, the data needs to be put in context through correlation with other sensor readings, sensor data histories, and stored data, as well as juxtaposing with maps and forecast models. In this paper we use a flood emergency response planning application to identify requirements for a semantic sensor web. We propose a generic service architecture to satisfy the requirements that uses semantic annotations to support well-informed interactions between the services. We present the SemSorGrid4Env realisation of the architecture and illustrate its capabilities in the context of the example application.},
