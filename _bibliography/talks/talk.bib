  abstract = {Machine processable descriptions of datasets can help make data more FAIR; that is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. However, there are a variety of metadata profiles for describing datasets, some specific to the life sciences and others more generic in their focus. Each profile has its own set of properties and requirements as to which must be provided and which are more optional. Developing a dataset description for a given dataset to conform to a specific metadata profile is a challenging process. 

In this talk, I will give an overview of some of the dataset description specifications that are available. I will discuss the difficulties in writing a dataset description that conforms to a profile and the tooling that I've developed to support dataset publishers in creating metadata description and validating them against a chosen specification.},

However, to maximise the potential from all this data, it needs to be combined and coerced into models that enable analysis and interpretation. In this talk I will give an overview of the techniques that I have developed for data integration: integrating streams of sensor data with background contextual data and supporting multiple interpretations of linking data together. At the end of the talk I will overview the work I will be conducting in the Administrative Data Research Centre for Scotland.},

  abstract = {When are two entries about a concept in different datasets the same? If they have the same name, properties, or some other criteria? The choice depends upon the application to which the data will be put. However, existing Linked Data approaches provide a single global view over the data with no way of varying the notion of equivalence to be applied. 

In this presentation, I will introduce Scientific lenses, an approach that enables applications to vary the equivalence conditions between linked datasets. They have been deployed in the Open PHACTS Discovery Platform – a large scale data integration platform for drug discovery. To cater for different use cases, the platform allows the application of different lenses which vary the equivalence rules to be applied based on the context and interpretation of the links.},

@Misc{Gray2014BrightonSeminar,
  abstract =     {The discovery of new medicines requires pharmacologists to interact with a number of information sources ranging from tabular data to scientific papers, and other specialized formats. The Open PHACTS project, a collaboration of research institutions and major pharmaceutical companies, has developed a linked data platform for integrating multiple pharmacology datasets that form the basis for several drug discovery applications. The functionality offered by the platform has been drawn from a collection of prioritised drug discovery business questions created as part of the Open PHACTS project. Key features of the linked data platform are:
1) Domain specific API making drug discovery linked data available for a diverse range of applications without requiring the application developers to become knowledgeable of semantic web standards such as SPARQL;
2) Just-in-time identity resolution and alignment across datasets enabling a variety of entry points to the data and ultimately to support different integrated views of the data;
3) Centrally cached copies of public datasets to support interactive response times for user-facing applications.

Within complex scientific domains such as pharmacology, operational equivalence between two concepts is often context-, user- and task-specific. Existing linked data integration procedures and equivalence services do not take the context and task of the user into account. We enable users of the Open PHACTS platform to control the notion of operational equivalence by applying scientific lenses over linked data. The scientific lenses vary the links that are activated between the datasets which affects the data returned to the user
