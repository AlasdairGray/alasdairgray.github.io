I once again attended the [European BioHackathon](https://www.biohackathon-europe.org/) which took place in November outside of Paris. It was another intense week with 150 developers from across Europe (and beyond) working together on [34 topics](https://www.biohackathon-europe.org/projects). 

[Bioschemas](https://bioschemas.org) was well represented in the topics and the hacking activities of the week. By the end of the week we had an approach for marking up Intrinsically Disordered Proteins and Rare Disease resources. We also had several resources with newly [deployed](https://bioschemas.org/liveDeploys/) or improved Bioschemas markup.

For a fuller overview of the event and outcomes, please see the [ELIXIR news item](https://elixir-europe.org/news/hackers-meet-develop-life-science-resources).
