SensorBench [[1](#paperkey_4){.papercite_bibcite}] is a benchmark suite for wireless sensor networks. The design of wireless sensor network systems sits within a multi-dimensional design space, where it can be difficult to understand the implications of specific decisions and to identify optimal solutions. SensorBench enables the systematic analysis and comparison of different techniques and platforms, enabling both development and user communities to make well informed choices. The benchmark identifies key variables and performance metrics, and specifies experiments that explore how different types of task perform under different metrics for the controlled variables. The benchmark is demonstrated by its application on representative platforms.
