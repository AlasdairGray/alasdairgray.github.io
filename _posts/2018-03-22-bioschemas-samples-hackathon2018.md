Last week the [Bioschemas Community](http://bioschemas.org) hosted a workshop. The focus of the meeting was to get web resources describing biological samples to embed [Schema.org](http://schema.org) mark up in their pages. The embedded mark up will enable the web resources to become more discoverable, and therefore the biological samples also.

I was not able to attend the event but Justin Clark-Casey has written this [blog post](http://justincc.org/a-buzzbang-tinged-report-on-the-ebi-bioschemas-samples-hackathon/) summarising the event.
