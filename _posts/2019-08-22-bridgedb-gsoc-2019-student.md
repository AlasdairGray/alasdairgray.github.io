During the summer, [BridgeDb](http://bridgedb.org) has had a Google Summer of Code student working on extending the system to work with secondary identifiers; these are alternative identifiers for a given resource.

The student [Manas Awasthi](https://medium.com/@marvex17) has maintained a blog of his experiences. Below are some excerpts of his activity.

The term I was introduced to by my seniors in my freshman year. Having no clue about open source, I started gathering knowledge about <em>‘How to contribute to open source projects?’ </em>Then I came across version control, being a freshman it was an unknown territory for me. I started using Github for my personal projects which gave me a better understanding of how to use it. Version Control Service was off the checklists. By the time all this was done Google Summer of Code 2018 was announced.

Plenty of coding along with plenty of learning. From the code base to the test suite.

Let&#8217;s discuss my progress through week 3 and 4 of GSoC’s coding period. So the major part of what I was doing this week was to add support for the secondary identifier (err!!! whats that) to BridgeDb.

In this blog I’ll go through the functionality I have added over the summer and why the end-users should use it.
