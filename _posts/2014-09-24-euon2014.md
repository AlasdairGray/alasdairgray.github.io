Tomorrow I will be talking at the 1st European Ontology Network meeting ([EUON](http://www.eudat.eu/euon)) about the work I have been doing in the W3C Health Care and Life Sciences ([HCLS](http://www.w3.org/wiki/HCLSIG)) Interest Group on creating a community profile for describing datasets.

The work on the HCLS Dataset Description Community Profile has been ongoing for two years now and is just about to reach fruition.Â Please do read the latest [Editors&#8217; Draft](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/joejimbo/HCLSDatasetDescriptions/blob/master/Overview.html) and provide feedback.
