The new year started with a new publication, an article in the [2018 NAR Database issue](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/46/D1/D1/4781210) about the [IUPHAR Guide to Pharmacology Database](http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/).

My involvement came from Liam Bruce&#8217;s honours project. Liam developed the [RDB2RDF](https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/RDB2RDF) mappings that convert the existing relational content into an RDF representation. The mappings are executed using the [Morph-RDB](https://github.com/oeg-upm/morph-rdb) R2RML engine.

To ensure that we abide by the [FAIR data principles](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618), we also generate machine processable metadata descriptions of the data that conform to the [HCLS Community Profile](https://www.w3.org/TR/hcls-dataset/).

Below is an altmetric donut so you can see what people are saying about the paper.
