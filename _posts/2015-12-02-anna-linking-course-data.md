During the summer my colleague [Phil Barker](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~philb/) (author of the [Sharing and Learning blog](http://blogs.pjjk.net/phil/)) and I hosted a summer intern, [Anna Grant](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annalgrant).

Anna&#8217;s project was to investigate the feasibility of publishing the data about our courses as Linked Data. Phil subsequently wrote up a blog post about the work which I have been meaning to share for a long time, so here it is; long overdue.

Below I have picked out some quotes from Phil&#8217;s original blog post that describe the work that Anna did.

> The objectives for Anna’s work were ambitious: survey existing HE [Higher Education] open data and ontologies in use; design an ontology that we can use; develop an interface we can use to create and publish our course data. Anna made great progress on all three fronts.

> The ontologies reviewed were: [AIISO](http://vocab.org/aiiso/schema), [Teach](http://linkedscience.org/teach/ns/), [CourseWare](http://www.resist-noe.org/index.html), [XCRI](http://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail/?pid=000000000030259242), [MLO](ftp://ftp.cenorm.be/PUBLIC/CWAs/e-Europe/WS-LT/CWA15903-00-2008-Dec.pdf), [ECIM](ftp://ftp.cen.eu/CEN/Sectors/TCandWorkshops/Workshops/CWA16077.pdf) and [CEDS](https://ceds.ed.gov/). A [live working draft of the summary / review](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Aqp-x1j1Vzoo3d3tPateL8DBiByCnbhBsJ4r1hTdZgg/edit?usp=sharing) for these is available for comment as a Google Doc.

> Anna has finished her work here now and returns to Edinburgh Napier University to finish her Master’s project. Alasdair and I think she has done a really impressive job, not least considering she had no previous experience with RDF and semantic technologies. We’ve also found her a pleasure to work with and would like to thank her for her efforts on this project.
