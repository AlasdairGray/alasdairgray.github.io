What are the research and technical challenges of linked data that are relevant to data science?

This presentation introduces the ideas of linked data using the BBC sport web site as an example. It then identifies several research challenges that remain to be addressed.

This presentation was given at the [launch event](http://workshops.inf.ed.ac.uk/datascience/launch/ "SICSA Data Science Theme Launch Event") of the [SICSA Data Science](http://www.sicsa.ac.uk/themes/data-science "SICSA Data Science theme") theme.
